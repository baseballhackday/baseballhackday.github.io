=========================

The new Baseball Hack Day website 

Available at <a href="http://baseballhackday.github.io">baseballhackday.github.io</a> and eventually moved to <a href="baseballhackday.com">baseballhackday.com</a>


### Test the site locally

    $ bundle install

in the directory of the project, it will install the github versions of jekyll and all dependencies. Then you can run 

    $ bundle exec jekyll serve -w

which will serve the site on localhost using the same settings that github uses, at

http://localhost:4000
