      %p Love creating stuff on your computer and LOVE baseball? Come hack with us on March 28 at The Boston Globe, <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/135+William+T+Morrissey+Blvd,+Boston,+MA+02125/@42.3155726,-71.0488811,17">135 William T Morrissey Blvd, Boston, MA 02125</a>!

      %p The fourth annual Baseball Hack Day is a fun, friendly one-day hacking competition (also known as hackathon, hackfest or codefest) for baseball fans.

      %p It is the day where area baseball minds come together and see what cool projects can be created within a limited time. The project could be (but is not limited to) a tool, app, website, or data visualization. Baseball Hack Day is a free event thanks to our generous sponsors. The event is based on the principal of <a href="http://hackdaymanifesto.com/">the Hack Day Manifesto</a>.

      %p See what we did in <a href="http://baseballhackday.challengepost.com/submissions">2014</a>, <a href="https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/boston-baseball-hack-day-2013/hacks">2013</a>, and <a href="/2012">2012</a> to get an idea.

    %h2 New for Boston 2015

    %article
      %p New to hack days? Have no fear. To encourage participation of developers and designers of all levels, there will be <strong>three tracks</strong>:

      %ul
        %li First, <strong>"hacking track"</strong> is our usual, typical Baseball Hack Day track. You come with project and recruit people, or come and find a project to join and work on it for the day. 
        %li Second one is a <strong>"project track"</strong>, where we have project/challenge ready to be worked on. There will be a "project manager" or "leader" type person to lead the team(s) to solve the challenge. 
        %li Third one is a <strong>learning track</strong>, which is mostly designed for first-time hackathon attendees. This is where you can learn how to hack from Baseball Hack Day's mentor volunteers. Less like competition and more like a workshop. 

  %section.guidelines
    %h2 Guidelines &amp; Rules

    %article
      %p First and foremost, this event will be a success if everyone has a good time, so rule number 1, please don't do anything that would detract from the fairness or fun of the event. Respect your fellow hackers.
      %p We are using a hack submission service called <a href="http://www.challengepost.com">ChallengePost</a>. In order to win, you need to submit the hacks through it. It helps organizers keep track of the teams and the projects they create.
      %p Hacks could be (but are not limited to) a tool, application, software, website, or data visualization and may be built using any programing language and platform that you choose. Teams can be of any size, but awards are only given to up to four individuals. Hacks will be judged for 1) Creativity/Originality, 2) Design/Presentation, and 3) Execution/Functionality.
      %p The majority of your coding must happen during the event. Some work done prior to the event is allowed, but it should be disclosed at your demo. Ideas that are compact and executable in one-day format are encouraged, and we will reward teams that recognize this time constraint.
      %p At 5:30 p.m., you will have 3 to 5 minutes of presentation and demo time (depending on how many projects there are). Judges also will come around during the event and you are encouraged to tell them about your projects at that time.
      %p Prototypes/mockups for demo is OK, but *working* websites or mobile apps are strongly encouraged.
